# Making commits
Any new feature you wish to add will need to be in a new branch:
> git checkout -b feature/newFeature
And then rebase with master to make sure your branch is as up-to-date as possible when making the pull-request:
> git pull --rebase origin master
and push your commits to the remote (setting upstream):
> git push -u origin feature/newFeature
and then submit a pull request. When itâ€™s been merged, you can run:
> git checkout master
> git pull --rebase origin master
> git remote prune origin
